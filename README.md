My config files

## Important dotfiles:
- nvim/init.vim ([Neovim](https://neovim.io/) config, mostly compatible with Vim)
- zshrc (Config for ZSH with a lot of Oh-my-zsh plugins https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh has settings for all my aliases, commonly used tools and a few wrappers around the more awkward parts of my work flow)
- bin (scripts and tools that I love, or hacked together)
 - cacher (caches the output of bash/zsh commands)
 - switch (swaps two i3 workspaces)
 - gogit (attempts to open a github page relevant to the current git repo)
- i3 (config for i3)
 - my_dmenu.sh (a wrapper around dmenu to add Hack font)
 - i3status.conf (settings for py3status bar for i3) 
- nixos (my old nixos config, hoping to come back to it one day)
